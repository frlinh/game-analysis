# Champions Mastery Analysis

## Project Overview
**Topic:**

We will use the dataset provided by Kaggle and Riot Games to determine the duration and learning curve to master each Champion.

**Reason:**

We are a group of individuals who are interested in gaming data and want to help beginners choose their first Champion.

**Questions:**

- Are the newer Champions harder to learn than the original Champions?

- How many matches would it take to master a Champion?

- Which Champions would be easiest to learn in each role?

- Which Champions have similar characteristics?
