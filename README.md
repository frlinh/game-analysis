Why did we pick this game? League of Legends is one of the most popular PC games in the world with a massive global playerbase and over 8 million players a day; we picked this game due to the sheer popularity and longetivy of the platform. This game has been around for a decade plus and is still proving to be highly succesful, while also getting multiple developer updates regularly.

----Slide 4

League of legends is what is known in the gaming community as a MOBA. What is MOBA? MOBA stands for Multiplayer Online Battle Arena.
The purpose of the game is to use your champion character and team up with four other champions (for a total of five) to face other teams of champions and destroy their base. Kinda like basketball, but with demons and assassins.

----Slide 5

THe first thing you must do to start this game is to choose your champion. With over 150  to choose from due to its ever-expanding roster of playable Champions, this is not always easy. League of Legends has developed a reputation of having a high barrier to entry. Not every champion is built the same and each of them have a unique gang of powers and skills. Once you have selected your champion, you must select one of five roles, TOP, mid bottom and more nuances such as jungle adc and support. We will not get into each role but know that each champion is built to fit into certains roles better than others.

So How does the game divide the players. You cant have the brand new user playing the five time Esports champion. The game divides players using a ranking system. If you are a fresh user you will be seperated into the players that are also brand new.
LoL has a ranking system for competitive gameplay that has 9 tiers. Each tier is divided into 4 divisions (with IV being the lowest and I being the highest). You move up tiers by winning and gaining League Points.  
Using the 3 highest ranks in our analysis 

-----SLide 7 Champion points

champion points are earned everytime you play a game
Our analysis is built to distinguish the Champions recommended for entry level players and the champions for those who like to take the road less traveled.
